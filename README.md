# DepecheR is an R package for clustering cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing data according to a minimal set of biological markers. 
This is done using repeated application of a penalized k-means algorithm, which penalizes partitions that depend on a large number of markers. DepecheR tunes the level of penalization by testing a range of penalization levels, thus minimizing the need for assumptions and arbitrary decisions. Technical documentation is found in /man/.
