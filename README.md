# DepecheR is an R library for grouping single-cell omics data according to a minimal set of biological markers. This is done using repeated application of a penalized k-means algorithm, which penalizes partitions that depend on a large number of markers. DepecheR tunes the level of penalization by testing a range of penalization levels. Technical documentation is found in /man/.
