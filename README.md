# DepecheR is an R package for clustering cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing data according to a minimal set of biological markers. 
This is done using repeated application of a penalized k-means algorithm, which penalizes partitions that depend on a large number of markers. DepecheR tunes the level of penalization by testing a range of penalization levels, thus minimizing the need for assumptions and arbitrary decisions. Technical documentation is found in /man/, but are most easily accessible by installing the package and accessing the help files. Please see the DepecheR wiki pages (https://github.com/Theorell/DepecheR/wiki/Downloading-DepecheR,-getting-it-to-run,-and-accessing-help-files) for additional information on installation, etc.
