Changes in version 1.7.2 (2021-03-25)
+ Major internal changes to the depeche function, with two user consequences:
    o The dualDepeche option is deprecated, as it made the function very heavy
    to maintain and was not flexible enough to be of great use.
    o The interface to dAllocate is much improved, allowing for smooth
    allocation of new data to an established model, which makes large
    dualDepeche runs, constructed outside of the function, possible in a more
    versatile way than previously.

+ its sparsity.

+ further information. Highly recommended to test!
