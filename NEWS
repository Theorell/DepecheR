DepecheR v0.99.31 (Release date: 2019-03-13)
Changes:
* dColorPlot and dDensity plot simplified, in that it is now possible to add

* The options createDirectory and directoryName have been removed from all 
* visualization functions and have been replaced by plotDir.

* plotName in all instances, to avoid using base function names for objects.
* The testData dataset has been made smaller, to increase example execution time
* and diminish pacakge size.

* dViolins completely worked over. Now, assymetrical violin plots are generated, 
* leading to a more succinct result. 
* Responses to all issues raised by BioConductor reviewer.
* Bug fix in dual depeche
